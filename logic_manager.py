"""
logic_manager.py -- the business rules (Logic layer).

Takes one maintenance check that the AI has already scored and applies our rules:
  - evaluate(): the facts (overdue by km OR time, km/day, COE days left, service-by date)
  - score():    a 0-100 risk score, used only to sort the urgent list
  - route():    the final outcome text; includes the urgency + confidence rule
Rules held here: overdue = whichever limit comes first, brake pads and tyres are
safety-critical, the "service by" date (business rule 3) and the Singapore COE rules.
All arithmetic is done here, not by the AI. No screen, AI or file access.
See explanations/logic_manager_explained.txt for a full walkthrough.
